# Minesweeper
My attempt at coding the classic game, [Minesweeper](http://minesweeperonline.com)

##N-Dimensions

This version of the game is experimental and aims to create a version of Minesweeper with any number of dimensions. 
For reasons of reality, this does not include a visual representation of the game but merely a text-based console.
